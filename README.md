# Python_Jupyter_Mini_Project_Toscano_Julia
My Python code calculates the equation of the best fit line, correlation coefficient and the squared correlation coefficient of the data in acidmax.csv which is data I am using in my chemisty lab report (the acid dissociation constant (pKa) and electrostatic potential). Its actually using the column labeled HF which just means Hartree-Frock calculation of the electrostatic potential because thats the one I wanted for my project. It then graphs a scatterplot of the data and the best fit line. The code reads the data, sets them as x and y and then calculates the slope, intercept and R with the np.sum function. It then prints those values and plots the line in the form of y = intercept + slope * x. Just upload acidmax.csv to collab.
